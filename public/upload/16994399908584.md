## Refund Policy and Service Guidelines

By registering with DIGIRDP or subscribing to our services, you acknowledge and agree to our refund policy. This policy has been established to enhance your user experience and is governed by specific guidelines and requirements. We kindly request that you carefully review this policy to prevent any potential issues. Please be aware that this policy is subject to change at any time, with or without notice.

### Refund Requests

Our refund policy outlines the procedures for requesting and receiving refunds for our services. To process a refund for RDP plans, a valid reason is required. In cases where a valid reason is provided, we will make efforts to resolve the issue or issue a refund. However, we are not obligated to provide a refund if you have violated our terms of service.

### Refund Ineligibility

Refunds will not be accepted for the following reasons:

1. Ignorance about the proper usage of RDP.
2. Unsuitable network connections at the client's end.
3. Technical issues at the client's end that prevent optimal product usage.
4. Issues related to third-party software. (Clients should contact the third-party software's support for assistance in case of corruption or tampering.)

Please note that our refund policy does not apply to the Dedicated Servers, Residential RDP ISP/proxy Fee, or VPS product categories. Invalid claims or frivolous reasons are not eligible for a refund.

### Prohibited Activities

We strictly prohibit activities such as Hacking, Brute-forcing, and the use of Mass Mailing Tools, as they are illegal. Clients are not allowed to use these activities with the servers provided by DIGIRDP.

### Admin RDP Server Policy

Our server managers are available 24/7 to assist you. Feel free to contact us at any time. Occasionally, server maintenance may be performed, which could involve server restarts.

### Residential RDP ISP/Proxy Fee Policy

There is no refund policy for our Residential RDP ISP and proxy fees. In cases where a refund is warranted, it will be issued after deducting the ISP/Proxy cost, which varies based on the plan and starts at $9.99. If any proxy or ISP issues are identified, we will address them promptly, depending on the issue and holiday schedule.

### Server Setup

We have specified setup times for all products. Claims regarding server delays or non-delivery will not be accepted within the setup time.

### Abuse Policy

We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone. Any content that is deemed obscene or threatening, in our judgment, is prohibited and may be removed from our servers with or without notice. Failure to respond to our abuse department's email within 48 hours may result in service suspension or termination. All abuse-related issues should be communicated via a support ticket/email, and we will respond within 48 hours.

### Child Pornography Prohibition

Hosting or linking to child pornography or content perceived as child pornography is strictly forbidden. Any server found in violation will be suspended immediately, without notice, and the appropriate law enforcement agencies will be notified.

### Important Notes

- If you violate our Terms of Service, no refund will be provided.
- You agreed to our Terms of Service and Refund Policy during payment. Payment providers such as PayPal or Payza also follow our policies for refunds.
- If you do not agree with the above rules and restrictions, please refrain from placing a Server or RDP order.
