This Service Agreement ("Agreement") outlines the terms and conditions governing the use of DigiRDP's services ("Service") by the subscriber ("Subscriber"). By accessing or using the Service, the Subscriber agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the Subscriber does not agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, they must not access or use the Service.

##1. Provision of Service

DigiRDP will provide the Subscriber with access to the Service as described in the order form or subscription agreement. This includes maintenance of the hardware and network infrastructure necessary for Internet connection and a password for authentication during use. The Subscriber does not have any rights or title to DigiRDP's equipment or software or any third-party equipment used by DigiRDP to provide the Service.

2. Payment

The Subscriber agrees to pay all fees invoiced by DigiRDP via PayPal, Bitcoin, credit card, Perfect Money, Moneybookers, or WebMoney. DigiRDP may, at its discretion, accept other forms of payment. If the Subscriber has elected to automatically transact payments to DigiRDP, the invoice sent by email will serve as their receipt of payment. If the Subscriber has not elected to automatically transact payments or an automatically-transacted payment fails, the Subscriber must promptly pay any invoiced charges to DigiRDP before the invoice due date.

3. Refund Policy

DigiRDP's refund policy is designed to provide a better user experience and is subject to change at any time with or without notice. To process a refund for RDP plans, a valid reason must be provided by the Subscriber. DigiRDP will try to resolve the issue or issue a refund if a valid reason is provided. Refunds are not available in certain circumstances, including ignorance about the proper usage of RDP, network connection issues at the client's end, technical issues at the client's end, and issues with third-party software. Refunds are also not available for dedicated servers, residential RDP ISP/proxy fees, or VPS products. Invalid claims or unreasonable reasons are not eligible for a refund.

4. Term and Termination

This Agreement remains in effect until notice of termination is provided by either the Subscriber or DigiRDP. The Agreement and the Subscriber's access to the Service will terminate as follows: the Subscriber may terminate at the end of the current billing cycle, DigiRDP may terminate with 30 days' notice, DigiRDP may terminate with 15 days' notice if the Subscriber fails to correct a breach of this Agreement, and DigiRDP may immediately and without notice terminate if, at its sole discretion, the Subscriber violates the Acceptable Use Policy.

5. Prohibited Activities

The Subscriber agrees not to use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose, including but not limited to hacking, brute-forcing, or mass mailing. DigiRDP strictly prohibits these activities and reserves the right to immediately terminate the Service if they are detected.
