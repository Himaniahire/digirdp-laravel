Our refund policy outlines the guidelines for requesting and receiving a refund for our service. Below are the key points to keep in mind:

To process a refund for RDP plans, we require a valid reason. If you provide a valid reason, we will try to resolve the issue or issue a refund.
Refunds are not available in certain circumstances, including ignorance about the proper usage of RDP, network connection issues at the client's end, technical issues at the client's end, and issues with third-party software.
Refunds are also not available for dedicated servers, residential RDP ISP/proxy fees, or VPS products. Invalid claims or unreasonable reasons are not eligible for a refund.
Hacking, brute-forcing, and mass mailing tools are strictly prohibited and not allowed on our servers.
We do not offer refunds for residential RDP ISP and proxy fees. If there is an issue with the proxy or ISP, we will try to fix it as soon as possible.
We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone and to remove any material that we consider obscene or threatening. Failure to respond to an email from our abuse department within 48 hours may result in the suspension or termination of your services.
Any potential harm to minors, including child pornography, is strictly forbidden and will result in the immediate suspension of your service without notice. Violations will also be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency.
If you violate our terms of service, no refund will be made. By making a payment, you agree to our terms of service and refund policy. If you disagree with these rules and restrictions, please do not place an order for a server or RDP.
No refund will be issued for those who make cancellation requests without seeking support or waiting at least 24 hours after creating a ticket.
