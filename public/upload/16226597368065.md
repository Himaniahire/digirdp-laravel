Registering with DIGIRDP or subscribing to our service means you agree to our refund policy, we have enacted a refund policy to provide better user experience, the policy is based on some guidelines and information that you should follow. Kindly read it carefully to avoid any issues that may arise. This policy can be changed at any time with or without any notice. 

To process the refund for RDP plans, we need a conclusive reason before you ask for a refund. The user must provide any conclusive reason, we will try to resolve the issue or a refund will be issued. You are no longer guaranteed a refund if you violate our TOS, we may still provide a partial refund but we are not obligated to do so if you have done something atrocious.

## Refunds on grounds of the pretexts mentioned below will not be accepted :
 
-  Ignorance about the proper usage of RDP.
 
- Unsuitable network connection at the client’s end.
 
- Other technical reasons at the client’s end that prevent him/her from using our product to its optimal efficiency.
 
- Issues concerning third-party software.  ( If a 3rd party software or Bot is corrupted or a tampered refund will not be given for that reason, you should contact their support to get it solved.)

- Refund Policy does not apply to the Dedicated Servers / Residential RDP ISP Fee / Indian RDP/VPS product category.
 
- Invalid claims or silly reasons are NOT eligible for a refund.
 
## DIGIRDP strictly does not condone Hacking/ Brute-forcing/ Mass Mailing Tools. They are illegal and hence clients will not be able to use them, with the servers provided by us.
Admin RDP Server Policy :
 
- Our Server managers are at your service 24X7. Please feel free to contact us anytime.
 
- No encoding of videos is allowed in admin RDP servers.
 
- Server maintenance will be done occasionally which may involve restarting of a server.
