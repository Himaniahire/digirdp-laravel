Our refund policy outlines the guidelines for requesting and receiving a refund for our service. To process a refund for RDP plans, we require a valid reason. If you provide a valid reason, we will try to resolve the issue or issue a refund. However, if you violate our terms of service, we are not obligated to provide a refund.

There are certain circumstances in which refunds will not be accepted, including ignorance about the proper usage of RDP, issues with network connection at the client's end, technical issues at the client's end, and issues with third-party software. Refunds are also not available for dedicated servers, residential RDP ISP/proxy fees, or VPS products. Invalid claims or unreasonable reasons are not eligible for a refund.

We strictly prohibit the use of hacking, brute-forcing, or mass mailing tools, which are illegal and not allowed on our servers. Our server managers are available 24/7 to assist you. Server maintenance may occasionally be required, which may involve restarting the server.

We do not offer refunds for residential RDP ISP and proxy fees. If there is an issue with the proxy or ISP, we will try to fix it as soon as possible. We have specified setup times for all products, and within this time frame, we will not accept any claims regarding pending or undelivered servers.

We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone and to remove any material that we consider obscene or threatening. Failure to respond to an email from our abuse department within 48 hours may result in the suspension or termination of your services. Any potential harm to minors, including child pornography, is strictly forbidden and will result in the immediate suspension of your service without notice. Violations will also be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency.

It is important to note that if you violate our terms of service, no refund will be made. By making a payment, you agree to our terms of service and refund policy. If you disagree with these rules and restrictions, please do not place an order for a server or RDP. Additionally, no refund will be issued for those who make cancellation requests without seeking support or waiting at least 24 hours after creating a ticket.
